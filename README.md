# computational_seismology

This repository contains jupyter notebooks to be used as suplementary material for the book [Computational Seismology,A Practical Introduction](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/computational-seismology-9780198717409?cc=de&lang=en&) by Heiner Igel.

All directories refer to an specific chapter according with the numbering in their names.
